- Am I interested in blogging? Should that be a main portion of my site?
- Do I want to limit things to a single page?

These quick four questions will help you narrow down exactly what your portfolio should include. For example, let’s walk through the questions. The type of content hosted on your portfolio could range from simply just your resume and accomplishments to: a series of blog posts, freelance development work, side hobbies, your social media feeds, pictures and videos, you name it. Understanding what this content is will help you decide on a layout for your site. If it’s primarily text based, you might want to emphasize a crisp, clean font and easy to read headings. If it’s more picture based, you'll want to ensure pictures load fast and are in good quality. You want to maximize the user’s experience while visiting your portfolio. If you think you might start blogging, you could always add that in later. However, if you want blogging to be a main focus of your site, that plays heavily into the layout and design. Let's start to put the pieces together as we look at exactly what to include in your portfolio.

### What Should You Include?

- **Your name and picture.** Including your name is a no-brainer, but I’ve seen quite a few portfolios that didn’t include their picture. In my opinion, this helps viewers create a connection with you. It doesn’t have to be the main focus, but it helps add character to your site.
- **Contact information.** Once they’ve decided they want to interview you, they need an avenue to reach you. Give them as many as you’d like. Include your phone number, email address, or any other method of contact you prefer.
- **Resume.** Your portfolio will allow you to elaborate more on your work experience, education, and project history, but you should still include a downloadable link to your resume in whatever format you choose (I prefer .pdf) for convenience.
- **Your skills.** What programming languages are you proficient in? Which ones do you have experience with? What libraries or frameworks have you used? Are you a master of any certain software? These are all great things to include to show your technical aptitude. Be cautious though: this shouldn’t be a list of every programming language or buzzword you can think of. A lot of employers will treat anything on your resume or portfolio as fair game when it comes to a technical interview. If you’ve only used C++ for one school project, you might not want to include that.
- **Information about yourself.** Use this opportunity to let your personality shine and let the user learn about you. If they’re considering hiring you, they want to be sure they’d enjoy working with you on a daily basis. Include some of your hobbies and what you like to do in your free time. However, don’t just say “I like to code”. I would hope you like to code, and your portfolio should speak for that, but you don’t need to explicitly say it.
- **Social media profiles.** You might be wondering why I deem this as necessary. If you don’t link them here, you know what the employer is going to do? Search the internet for them. In my opinion, this provides some transparency. If your profiles are set to private, you don’t really have much to worry about anyway. LinkedIn is a must, as well as your GitHub account. If you don’t have a GitHub account, it’s time to make one.
- **Projects.** This may or may not apply to you. For current students and new grads, this is an opportunity to show you understand how to program even though you might not have a lot of real world experience. This gives the employer tangible examples of your work. Anyone can say they understand a programming language, but a complex project on your GitHub profile goes a lot farther than a simple bullet point.
- **Blog (optional).** Personally, I love portfolios that contain blog posts. Communication is such a major factor in determining whether or not you will get hired. The bottom line is: if you can’t communicate effectively, you probably won’t succeed. Showing your literacy through blog posts helps the employer see you’re an effective written communicator and also shows you’re passionate about something. Your blog posts don’t have to be technical. Write about whatever you enjoy. If you're serious about this, check our [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) or [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). (_Update January 2019_: Another option to consider is [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog)).

### Choosing A Design

It’s finally time to start creating your portfolio! At this time, you should have a rough idea of what you want things to look like. Depending on your proficiency with HTML/CSS/Javascript, you have the option of designing your website from scratch. However, my first approach was by starting off from a template. There’s quite a few advantages of using a template.

- It’s already responsive, meaning it will work on desktop or mobile.
- Most developers aren’t also designers. Designing is tough.
- It lowers the barrier to entry for beginning web developers.
- Ultimately, it saves you time and makes your life easier.

There are a variety of sites that offer templates 100% free under the Creative Commons license. Once you find a design you like, you will need a place to host the content. That's where GitHub Pages comes in. GitHub, which you should hopefully be familiarizing yourself with, offers free hosting for static websites using their service GitHub Pages. They’re extremely easy to setup and deploy, and require only a basic understanding of git, a version control system. Git essentially allows you to track changes for your files and collaborate with others. If you haven’t created a GitHub account yet, you’ll need to do that now.

### Roadmap: Hosting, Deploying, and Securing

Rather than re-iterate what's already been documented, I'm going to link you to some great posts and provide you a roadmap for creating your portfolio.

1.  If you haven't already found a template, [here's a good resource](https://html5up.net/)
2.  [Create a repository for your portfolio and deploy it to yourname.github.io](https://pages.github.com/)
3.  Buy a domain from wherever is cheapest: [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/), [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/), [Register](https://www.register.com/), etc
4.  Prefer to use .com, .io, or .me. Try to include what people would search for, which is typically your name
5.  [Add your custom domain to your GitHub Pages repository](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-or-removing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/)
6.  [Configure your DNS for your new domain to point to GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-an-apex-domain/)
7.  Wait up to 24 hours for the changes
8.  [Use Cloudflare to secure (hopefully, in light of recent news) your portfolio with HTTPS](https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-and-fast-github-pages-with-cloudflare/)
9.  [Improve your SEO (Search Engine Optimization)](http://www.wordstream.com/meta-tags)
10. [Set up analytics with Fathom Analytics or Google Analytics](https://usefathom.com/ref/T93GOJ)
