If you've built sites using Eleventy before, you're probably familiar with [collections](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/collections/). Collections are a great feature to show blog posts on your site. If your posts are written inside of markdown files, you can give each post the `tags` key as front matter data to create a collection. 

Front matter in 11ty is placed inside opening and closing document separators `---` and uses YAML syntax. Two markdown files `post-one.md` and `post-two.md` will be the blog posts contained in the `posts` collection.

{% filename "post-one.md" %}

{% raw %}
```yaml
---
title: Blog post one
permalink: "/posts/{{ title | slug }}"
tags: posts
---
Some content in post one
```
{% endraw %}

{% filename "post-two.md" %}

{% raw %}
```yaml
---
title: Blog post two
permalink: "/posts/{{ title | slug }}"
tags: posts
---
Some content in post two
```
{% endraw %}

You might have noticed a `permalink` key in the front matter data. Eleventy's [permalink](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/permalinks/) does some cool stuff to make sure that "Cool URIs don't change". You can use the `permalink` key to remap a templates output to a path other than the default `inputPath`. The output from setting a `permalink` will leave off the file extension.

The two markdown files would be written to the `_site` output as:

```html
/posts/blog-post-one/
/posts/blog-post-two/
```
Using the `slug` filter works nicely to slugify your posts `title` key. The above permalink could also be written as `permalink: "/posts/blog-post-two/"` if you wanted to manually write the equivalent of {% raw %}`{{ title | slug }}`{% endraw %}. 

<h2 class="post-heading">Accessing Collection Data</h2>

Now that both of the blog posts have been given the `posts` tag. They can be easily accessed from the `posts` collection in the following way using a Nunjucks `for` loop.

{% raw %}
```html
{% for post in collections.posts %}
    <a href="{{ page.url }}">{{ post.data.title }}</a>
{% endfor %}
```
{% endraw %}

This would iterate over the `posts` collection and access the front matter data `title` to create a link to each blog post.

```html
<a href="/posts/blog-post-one/">Blog post one</a>
<a href="/posts/blog-post-two/">Blog post two</a>
```

If you wanted to show the markdown from blog posts in another template or layout file, you can use {% raw %}`{{ content | safe }}`{% endraw %}.

<h2 class="post-heading" id="handling-multiple-tags">Handling multiple tags</h2>

One way to create a new collection is simply by giving a `.md` file a new tag within the `tags` key. This method has been demonstrated above to access the `posts` collection.

When you have multiple tags on a blog post, such as `html`, `css`, `js`. You will add each tag to the `tags` key as a list of values. 

```yaml
---
tags: 
    - html
    - css
    - js
---
```

This is where creating a [custom collection](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/collections/) comes in handy. Instead of including the `posts` tag in the `tags` list for every blog post (which might be repetitive), just create a custom collection with the markdown files from `/posts/` inside the `.eleventy.js` file. This way you can omit `posts` from the tags list within front matter data. 

<h2 class="post-heading">Create Custom Collections</h2>

All blog posts in this article are saved as `.md` files in the `/posts/` directory. To create a custom collection, navigate to `.eleventy.js`. You will utilize the first argument of the config function `eleventyConfig` to call the API and use `addCollection` to create a new custom collection. 

You can add the markdown files within `/posts/` to the new collection using `getFilteredByGlob(glob)`, which will match an arbitrary glob or array of globs against the input file's full path (`inputPath`).

{% filename ".eleventy.js" %}

```js
module.exports = function(eleventyConfig) {
    // Creates custom collection "myPosts"
    eleventyConfig.addCollection("myPosts", function(collection) {
        return collection.getFilteredByGlob("/posts/*.md");
    });
}
```

Now a custom collection called `myPosts` has been created which contains all the markdown files in `/posts/`. You can access this custom collection just like a regular collection.

{% raw %}
```html
{% for article in collections.myPosts %}
    <h2>{{ article.data.title }}</h2>
{% endfor %}
```
{% endraw %}

Another useful method is `getFilteredByTags(tags)` which will retrieve any content that includes all of the tags passed in.

```js
eleventyConfig.addCollection("web", function(collection) {
    return collection.getFilteredByTags("html", "css", "js");
});
```

<h2 class="post-heading">Filter Recent Posts</h2>

If you wanted to dedicate a section of the page for some of your most recent blog posts. You could create a custom sorted collection and perform a `slice` array operation to filter the number of recent posts.

```js
eleventyConfig.addCollection("recentPosts", function(collection) {
    return collection.getAllSorted().reverse().slice(0, 3);
});

```

<h2 class="post-heading">Conclusion</h2>

Custom collections along with the ability to build powerful shortcodes and filters in `.eleventy.js` using the [configuration API](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/config/) is one of the main reasons why #eleventy rocks!
